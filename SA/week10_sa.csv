"1","What did you find interesting about gamification as described in the article?The part that stuck out to me the most was the fourth paragraph under ""How: Goals and Techniques"": ""It [gamification] gives students clear, actionable tasks and promises them immediate rewards instead of vague long-term benefits...Games maintain this positive relationship with failure by making feedback cycles rapid and keeping the stakes low...in schools, on the other hand, the stakes of failure are high and the feedback cycles long. Students have few opportunities to try, and when they do, it is high stakes.""This resonated with me particularly in my experience with high-risk students where it's almost impossible to make them believe that school can help them succeed in life - the payoff is just too far away to make sense when there are all sorts of immediate gains that come from taking school less seriously, and they don't have to risk feeling stupid, particularly if they are already behind academically. Is gamification what you thought it was?I have read a little bit about gamification in the past, so Lee and Hammer's description fit with what I thought gamification was. How does gamification differ from actually using games? Gamification is using the techniques of games in a different context. It can mean turning an assignment into a game, but it can also refer to adding a ""game component"", like a competitive or cooperative element to the assignment. I think there is a lot of nuance around gamification and actually making it work in schools that will have to be discovered by trial and error. Gamification is a lot more than just switching from ""grades"" to ""experience points"", leaving everything else the same, and expecting student's motivation to be transformed. It required a much more in depth knowledge of what makes games appealing.I think a lot of the fun of games come from not being mandatory. So that's a hard line to draw in implementing gamification since we want all students to participate and we are accountable for them as teachers. I was thinking about our online learning community and how the book suggested (and Instructor has modeled this) that the community have places both for the required academic discussions/assignments, but also places for more causal, social interaction. Perhaps that is a lesson that could benefit gamification - in a classroom there could be certain games (or parts of a larger game) that are required, but there are also games (or areas of the larger game) that are low-stakes and just for fun. Students can get drawn in to the low-stakes game and work their way up to something more overtly educational.","MKI"

"6","O,You've hit on what intrigues me most about gamification, I think--redefining what success in school looks like and feels like. Games encourage repeating a level until you master it, and then moving on--and that's defined as normal and good. How do we do that in schools? ","MKC"
"7","Thanks for your thoughts, O.I agree with you - ""A lot of the fun of games come from not being mandatory."" Gamification, though, is about implementing gaming elements into the learning environment and activities, which can create a fun environment for the student that relates to the casual gamer. ","MKC"
"8","O- I agree with your thoughts in the first paragraph that it can be hard to keep students going when the outcome it so far away.  The article seem to really support the idea that gaming helps to keep students not only interested, but also helps to develop endurance.  The ability to keep at a task until you have success is a great life long skill.","MKC"
"9","I for sure see the potential for gamification in schools as described in the article and that schools already have some gamification in play (e.g., grades).  However, I like how they point out that grades and such are always high-stakes, whereas with games the stakes are always within reach and you get multiple chances to learn from failures.  Most importantly, I like the idea of returning fun to the learning.  When I was teaching high school I always had my students take a look at William Glasserês choice theory.  I would ask them when and how they get their various needs fulfilled.  Fun was always the tough one because most of the time fun was only had outside of school, but inevitably Iêd always find some students who craved this need so much in school that they would behave inappropriately.  It always came down to lake of time to be social.  Every time.  So, as a teacher what do you do with that?  I worked hard to create assignments or activities that forced my students to cooperate and sometimes compete, not always with success, but I found when I did give time for them to be social it paid off in terms of cutting down poor behavior.  However, itês a tough one because you only have so much time and lots of content to get through.I have read some of James Geeês work on gamification for other classes, so I was a little familiar with it prior to reading this article.  I am for sure intrigued about how to gamify aspects of school.  However, I do worry about the potential to fall into the extrinsic reward trap.  I think the interesting work will be to look into that line or space or whatever it is where young people (and adults) move away from the extrinsic reward and do it because they either enjoy it or made a commitment to it or they know they are learning from it or simply put, see value in it.  As I said, in my FlipGrid, I myself participate daily in to activities that use badges and rewards and even though itês a bit silly they do motivate me, but ultimately I do it because I see value in doing it.Gamification is the using of gaming techniques, not the game itself. I like how the authors argue, _a well-designed gamification system can help players take on meaningful roles that are fruitful for learning. By making the development of a new identity playful, and by rewarding it appropriately, we can help students think differently about their potential in school and what school might mean for them?(p. 4).  So, we can make school not this _game?that we all know and dread that we must get through to get to those potential rewards (e.g., graduation), but rather this game where you can try on new things safely and change constantly.  Iêm excited for it because gamification can foster curiosity, creativity, and ultimately can allow those involved to change the game itself.  Therefore, I see a lot more fluidity in gamification whereas the actual game is more set with specific rules and norms. ","MKI"

"19","Thanks for your thoughts, E.  Problem-solving skills and persistence do transfer into non-gaming environments as well. Problem-based learning is a great example of a situation that may be a non-gaming environment. Basically, students learn about a subject through problem-solving activities. Usually, in problem-based learning environments, students work collaboratively to solve a problem, and it creates a high level of self motivation. Gamification takes the elements of games (points, rewards, external motivation, fun) to increase student engagement and motivation. I suggest checking out the following from a presentation at a conference last year: http://sloanconsortium.org/conference/2013/et4online/hiding-broccol....      ","SKC"

"22","What did you find interesting about gamification as described in the article? At the third section _Why Bother: Risks and Benefits? it describes _?playfulness requires freedom _ freedom to experiment, to fail, to explore multiple identities, to control oneês own investment and experience. By making play mandatory, gamification might create rule-based experiences that feel just like school.?For me, Iêve always been thinking about that gamification, which applies game elements and converts homework assignments into quests, will provide students a joyful experience in education. And I ignored that the mandatory participation could still make students feel like the game-like course is just a change in form but not in content. It really is a reminder to me.Is gamification what you thought it was? Before starting exploring this topic, I thought Gamification is gamifying courses according to its literal meaning, however Iêm not sure whether games are applied. Now I know it is the use of game thinking and game mechanics in non-game contexts to engage users in solving problems. The articles changed my thought about Gamification, and made me re-recognize it. How does gamification differ from actually using games? I think, Gamification uses game thinking and game mechanics, which mimic the experience of passing through checkpoints in games, to promote the engagement of students. Instead, games have probability to distract students?attention from course content to game environment.","MKI"

I definitely see the benefits of using gamification in a classroom but I also think that it is important to recognize that it is not always going to work. I know for myself personally I was not necessarily a student who enjoyed these kind of activities while in school because they always seemed so pointless to me. But as I have gotten older and into a variety of classrooms I have seen these activities be very beneficial for some students.  Is gamification what you thought it was? I had some background knowledge/ideas on what gamification was so the description given in the article was pretty much what I thought it was.  How does gamification differ from actually using games?

The purpose of playing game is just for fun or enjoy. However gamification is to encourage people to work, study or do better by using the concept of game.  For example, Lee Sheldon, professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, discarded traditional grading in favor of earning _experience points?and converted homework assignments into quests (Laster, 2010).

"46","What did you find interesting about gamification as described in the article? _The most dramatic example of emotional transformation in a game is around the issue of failure. Because games involve repeated experimentation, they also involve repeated failure. In fact, for many games, the only way to learn how to play the game is to fail at it repeatedly, learning something each time (Gee, 2008). Games maintain this positive relationship with failure by making feedback cycles rapid and keeping the stakes low. The former means players can keep trying until they succeed; the latter means they risk very little by doing so. In schools, on the other hand, the stakes of failure are high and the feedback cycles long. Students have few opportunities to try, and when they do, it is high stakes. Little wonder that students experience anxiety, not anticipation, when offered the chance to fail (Pope, 2003).?Failure has been a common theme in my life for good and bad reasons. However, what I can take away from most of my experiences that most were not life altering and only life adjusting.  It is my strong belief, and supported with personal evidence, that without failure we donêt learn anything, we donêt push ourselves harder; we donêt reflection on our practice and identify what went wrong. However, in our schools, time is our greatest enemy. Students donêt have time to redo assignments or try something again most times without the hassles of trying to work on material from the past and present concurrently. I have found that my students will focus so much on creating finished works without allowing for the creative process to occur when working on projects. They want to get it right the first time without any experimentation and when it doesnêt look exactly like they want it to, they give up. Our students lack that piece that engages them, pulls them in and pushes their beliefs. We may even want to include another go to word: GRIT. MCA testing is next weeks so things might get really interesting in my building as the excitement builds for those!!! Is gamification what you thought it was? I had never heard the term before this course, but was pleasantly surprised as to what I have heard. I had a sense that it had something to do with technology and games, but thought more along the lines of using games for learning instead of the principles of gaming. How does gamification differ from actually using games? From my understanding _gamification?is the practice of using the ideals and structure of games in teaching. This is state that gamification is not simply using games for learning, but understanding the goals and appeal of games and using those elements in delivery of knowledge. Lee & Hammer discuss the opportunity to experiment with rules, emotions, and social roles within schools using this model. Instead of having students just play games the use of game structure teaches focuses on building skills in goal setting, presenting cognitive challenges when solving solving complex problems, understanding failure as a motivator, and creating social systems that students are able to gain recognition outside of the classroom.  The efforts of these means are directed at bringing in students that have become disillusioned with the current state of education and the brick and mortar school as well as to push the envelope in developing intelligences that are outside of the normal school focus. I really enjoyed, although outside of the reading, the Gabe Zichermann TED Talk when he mentioned the increase in fluid intelligence amoungst our Gen _G?kids and the global increase of IQ. Also, a big thanks to the group for bringing this to my attention. I really enjoyed reading the selected writing and will be reading all the optional texts as well !","MKI"

Games maintain this positive relationship with failure by making feedback cycles rapid and keeping the stakes low. The former means players can keep trying until they succeed; the latter means they risk very little by doing so. In schools, on the other hand, the stakes of failure are high and the feedback cycles long. Students have few opportunities to try, and when they do, it is high stakes. Little wonder that students experience anxiety, not anticipation, when offered the chance to fail (Pope, 2003).?Failure has been a common theme in my life for good and bad reasons.

"50","Hi T, Your points about kids wanting to get it right the first time is something I saw as a high school teacher and continue to see as a teacher-educator.  It's really difficult to break that pattern b/c it is so engrained in our schools.  They don't always want to engage and grapple with the project, but instead say, ""just tell me what to do, how to do it and I'll get it done.""  Where's the creativity?  Where's the critical thinking? Several weeks back my daughter came home saying her NWEA testing scores went down from the last test and she was really upset.  I'm beginning to think I might just join the parent opt-out movement.  At a young age it's already engrained into her that scores matter the most.  We have many a talk that the learning is in the questioning, in challenging yourself to do something difficult, in finding out where you made mistakes.  So, I'm on board with gamification in that respect.  If failure is seen as an opportunity to learn - I'm all for it.","MKC"

My understanding of gamification was deepened through activities and readings this week.

"58","Hi A, I think people' addiction to game is not only because of the fun it bring them, but also its tolerance of failure and opportunity to start over and over again until success, which satisfy their desire to achieve and even make up the missing part of their real life.

"65","I think that choosing a gamification strategy founded in sound pedagogy and properly incentivized (so as not to denigrate the lesser-performing students) can work to improve learning, but I wouldn't make the assumption that your design efforts around these will be rewarded with full engagement. I think these strategies are strong and fairly novel tools to support learning, but there are a variety of approaches to teaching and learning, and we should select options based on your learning objectives for the course. With the influx of gamification in everything from our interactions with retailers, countless phone app's, etc., its use is on the rise and is expected to become a normal aspect of nearly everything we do in our day-to-day lives, so we will soon see how well it works over the long-run, across its many applications.","DKI"
"66","S, I agree with your thought that we can't make the assumption- the gamification design efforts will be rewarded with full engagement. This is in consistent with the conclusion of this article- the traditional e-learning approach is more effective in assessing knowledge students get. This might be the drawback of using gamification and social networking in education, but it also offers opportunity for us to think why? And how to take advantage of them to improve learners' academic performance?","MKC"
"67","S I liked that you used the word ""tool"".  Gamification is one tool that can be used.  There are many good and valuable tools that can help teaching and learning and I can see where gamification has a place.","MKC"
"68","I agree that there are a variety of approaches to learning, and gamification is just one of them. I would not like to see it as the only tool. I do think it will prove to be a valuable approach. I find some of the blatant gamification applications in retail and apps pretty annoying, to tell the truth, but I like it better in education. Probably because I value the purpose it's serving more highly.","MKC"
"69","I would say that gamification enhances online learning communities because individuals are more actively participating and engaging in the work. Comparing gamification to straight lectures, there are fewer students who participates and are engaged in the work. It's definitely beneficial to have gamification and straight lecture when it comes to enhancing online learning communities because everyone has different learning styles and sometimes it's easier for one to learn through reading than doing more hands on activities. We see that social networking is more affective than gamification because of the participation level. More people participated in social networking because it was easy for them to build onto each other's ideas and help expand one another's knowledge. Finding a way to make one more engaged will help individuals with learning better. The more I actively participate in classrooms and online learning communities, the more I learn as well. It's just a matter of how one learns best.","DKI"
"70","I- I agree that the more activity and engaged you are the better learner and the more you will learn.  I am an older student and so games and technology is something that I have had to learn, unlike younger students where technology has been a part of their whole life.  I think that a balance of gamification and more traditional styles can benefits all students.","MKC"
"71","I had wished that this empirical study would have also included a qualitative study as well. I wondered whether the instrument was sensitive enough to detect differences. What differences in learners' academic performance were anticipated? __I think R's question is important - what approaches work best and when?__For example, is gamfication useful for motivating learning low level knowledge that is foundational for further learning?__Or does gamification need for the learner to have a certain attitude, such as more of an affinity toward competition?","MKC"
"72","yes, E. I also think it's useful to take a qualitative study in consideration. And it in deed has many qualitative study or mixed methods on online learning. In addition, how to decide the standard for teachers to assess students' academic performance is another important question. Different assessment standard would cause different results, I think.","DKC"
"73","I think that gamification can and should be used as one means to teach students and encourage engagement.  In my experience online learning communities are better when you mix up the means by which you are sharing and teaching the material.  An example is one week using a traditional lecture, and another week using a video or game.  Mixing up the activities allows the learner to stay engaged and always challenges them to use different skills.  S used the ""tool"", and I really thought this was a nice way to express the idea that gamification can be one tool in the educational tool box, that when used and used well can add to the overall experience of online learning communities.  ","DKI"
"74","Mixing up the activities is also good since we all learn differently, and so it allows for some individualized learning.","MKC"
"75","The term ""gamification"" is very new to me, and i really enjoyed all readings for this week. I think it is really good system and gamification is also able to encourage people to work, study or do better by using the concept of game. So, I would say ""Yes the gamification absolutely can enhances online learning community."" According to the reading ""An empirical study comparing gamification and social networking on e-learning"", it says Results suggest that the proposed instruments improve students?performance on practical assignments related to skill acquisition. Average performance improved in each experimental group even with low participation rates affecting the whole group significantly. Temporal evolution suggests that for initial assignments, social networking was a better option. Getting some compensation for what people do and feeling accomplishment would make people try hard and do better.","DKI"
"76","Gamification enhances online learning communities because of the way it makes people participate. There are benefits and drawbacks to it though. Different generations have a different experiences with gamification. Younger people can easily catch on to gamification and adapt quickly while navigating around. On the other hand, some older people may have a harder time trying to navigate around because it's something they aren't used to. Since some older people they aren't used to gamification, instead of spending more time learning about what is needed to be taught, they are spending more time on learning how to navigate around and how to be a good participant. Gamification is a good way to mix things up every once in a while so that students have a different way of learning because they may understand it better than reading or listening to lectures.","DKI"
"77","I think that gamification can enhance a learning community, but it doesn't always necessarily. Like any other teaching strategy, it depends on the skill of the teacher and how well they can use a given technique. The results of the experiment in the article weren't very compelling, though that doesn't mean that gamification couldn't work on a different situation. There are a lot of ways to ""do"" gamification, so I wouldn't want to draw conclusions basied on one article. It's a really broad concept with lots of possible interpretations and applications. I think we have to be careful about assuming that all kids would like gamification, and R is right on when she said that we can't make the assumption that gamification design efforts will be rewarded with full engagement. It's interesting that the results of the experiment shows better results for the blended group - perhaps the social rewards of connecting with your peers is more powerful than the arbitrary rewards provided by gamification. Like any other strategy, it's not going to work for every kid.","MKI"

"79","I agree with your point, O. I also think game is just a tool and it has many ways to do gamification. It depends on how to use it in learning. Because learning itself is a complex process, it's hard to make a general conclusion or assumption about how gamification works. Online gamification and social learning have many overlapps and differences. You mention a good point that deserves further research, that is the social presence of this two kinds of online learning. It's interesting, thank you!","MKC"
"80","This is an interesting question.  The article looks to see how to use gamification in school environments.  As I read it, I thought of _brick and mortar?type schools using gamification strategies in teaching and learning, not necessarily online learning environments.  I really like the idea of gamifying school when possible because I do believe it can make space for creativity and foster curiosity.  I was pretty sold in the _framework social gamification: guidelines and objectives?section, but when I got to _4.3 descriptive scenario?I have to admit I was let down.  I guess I felt like this potential scenario really only took activities you might already do in class, put them online, and made grades more visible.  I did not see the neat features of gamification that allow players to adapt or find a different route to success as described in the framework.  To me it felt like what already happens in school, just more public.  I want to see more space where students can interact and collaborate.  Let me give you an example. My oldest daughter (now 10) was introduced to this website while we were in the UK last spring where an author is writing a childrenês and s/he asks for the childrenês help.

"85","I think this is really an interesting question. I think gamification can definitely enhance a student's learning in an actual school setting but I am not certain it would enhance an online learning community in the same way. I have been in many different classrooms in the past couple of years where gamification has been used. Part of the learning experience that I have seen occur with students happened with the social interactions while playing the game.  For example I was recently in a 6th grade classroom where they were playing a game to learn about how the election works in the United States. They were the person running to be President and had to go around campaigning in order to win the election. During the game the kids would be talking to one another and explaining how they did things in order to win a state. This helped their learning experiences because they were able to bounce off ideas from one another and learn from each others mistakes. When it comes to gamification online, I think it would be more difficult to have this type of interaction with others because you would have to almost stop what you were doing every time you go stuck or needed help. I do think if there was a way you could interact with somebody without having to stop and type out what you needed help with that gamification could definitely enhancing learning in an online learning community.

"90","I think that depending on the grade level for incorporating gamification in online communities, it definitely could enhance online learning within communities.  Gamification provides an outlet to a interactive and creative type of mindset.  I would argue that gamification might not work for every student.  Some individuals prefer not read fiction novels for example, and based off of what I have read about gamification--it seems to be very creative and fiction oriented.  I think that for online communities to occur, an individual always has a choice to participate/join.  If the gamification setting is apparent in an online college, related course--students will either like this idea and register, or not like the way it is set up and not join.  For required elementary level courses I would be careful because the teacher wouldn't want to stray too far from the intial content of the class and subject.  I think the right level of creativity/rules/expectations for students is important.  A nice balance of these details would hopefully result in a successful, working online community.","DKI"

"92","It is still too early to answer affirmatively that gamification enhances learning for all students. It appears that gamification has the potential to improve learning for K-12 students. This is the generation that grew up with video games and are quite comfortable in such a virtual world. In my own family, my grandson started watching video games on iPad at an early age. Without reading the icons on a computer he knows the links to his favorable programs. He is not afraid to try various things on the iPad. Such a child will be quite comfortable using gamification for learning. I wonder, though, whether he will see it as an intellectual or learning activity. I am not sure I agree with the gentleman who gave the TED talk on gamification. He believes that the days of reading books and newspaper are over, and gamification is the future. He encourages parents to get in the game business with their children. I would be rather cautious about writing a premature obituary for books and newspaper, however. Videos or any other technological tools should be viewed as means to achieve learning, but the tools themselves are not the learning. Perhaps we should be asking whether contents are are these kinds learning when they use gamification. One concern I have as a parent about kinds' a deep immersion with gamification is the social isolation that it engenders. My grandson can be so consumed with video games that he does not want to eat or talk. We have had to impose a strict time limit on him. Too much exposure to gamification will lead to other unintended social problems in the future.","DKI"

"96","Thanks, C, for your question about whether video games cause future social problems. I was limiting my comments to my grandson who is beginning to exhibit social isolation due to what is appearing to be too much exposure to his iPad. Some of the shows he watches are video games, although I need to point out that he has not yet played video games. I have not read research that links video games to future social problems directly. What I do know is that there is good research studies indicating that distance education students exhibit high drop-out rates due to social isolation (Lee, M. J. W., & Chan, A. (2007). Reducing the effects of isolation and promoting inclusivity for distance learners through podcasting.

"97","Hi N,I'm glad you brought up the TED talk.  I also did not agree with the man on the TED talk.  My girls, particularly my almost 11 year old, loves to read a good old fashioned book and will do so for hours.  Her grandma gave her a Kindle (the super basic one) and she still prefers to go get books at the library.  She will download a library book to her Kindle only when she is done reading the actual books.  Her friends and her share books too.  So, I don't think days of paper backs or newspapers are actually over either.","MKC"
"98","Hi N, I am so impressed by your comments! I agree with you that the tools or technologies themselves are not the learning. They are means to achieve better learning and the key element is learners themselves. How they use these tools and technologies, including games. For kids, they are not mature enough to control the time they spend on gaming or they are not mature enough to really guide themselves to learn something from gaming. So, as far as I am concerned,  in this ""Gamification"" learning process, parents' and teachers' guide and management are important.","MKC"
"99","Do you think gamification enhances online learning communities? Why or why not? As my experience with gamification doesn't extend past the content that I have taken in over the last week, I am indeed intrigued about the concept and the role this game structure has played in my life. I am not extremely competitive, but when presented with an opportunity to gain badges or stock pile cash in my Pocket Trains app, I have no problem watching the hours tick by. There is potential to keep individuals engaged in the practice of online learning communities by bringing in these elements from game structure, but the research proposal we read left much to be desired in the way of direct research and an articulated focus outside of general suggestions. Another concern is the understanding the motivation of the individual. As I mentioned, the flashy badges might hook me in from the beginning, but the ability to sustain community might be questionable. Motivation becomes an important consideration whether the individuals are intrinsically or extrinsically influenced. A competitive nature does not apply to all, but again this is only one facet of the gamification framework. As a parent of two small children who also are ""digital natives"" I am concerned about the world they are going to be a part of in the not so near future. My oldest will be starting kindergarten next year and with tools mentioned like schooools.com I was intrigued about the possible benefits that might have with him. He loves using the iPad and loves the incentives that come about with beating a character on Mr. Crab, but the addictive nature of the game may not bode well for his lack of self-control.
