"1"," Identify 2 highlights from the readings. These could be quotes, ideas, or things you learned that resonated with you.One quote that stuck out to me was from page 163, chapter 8: ""Asking participants to comment on expectations gives the instructor a process check, a means by which to determine whether or not everyone is beginning this journey from approximately the same starting point."" This procedure of collaboratively determining the course goals is important not only for student buy-in, but also for the instructor's growth in the subject matter. The check-in with students about their expectations about what they are learning is important for the instructor to stay up-to-date on what knowledge is relevant in the real world, especially in classes geared towards adults who have practical experience of their own, and in subjects where the research and content is still evolving. Another quote that jumped out at me was from page 167, chapter 8: ""The process of connecting the learning gained from everyday life to the learning of the course not only creates a deeper sense of meaning for the participants but it validates them as people who possess knowledge and who can apply what they know in other contexts.""I happened to be reading another book recently that had a similar discussion. It was talking about how learners who automatically or deliberately connect what they are learning to things they already know tend to have a lot greater success in using and retaining their new knowledge. The challenge is that many learners don't do this automatically, but they will if asked. I wish that this learning about learning was something that was an automatic part of every class at every level of education, because it is so useful for life-long learning.  What is 1 connection/disconnection among the readings?I thought there was a strong connection between both chapter 8 and 9 and our previous discussion of communities of practice. Particularly the skill of providing substantial feedback (chapter 8 around page 176-179) jumped out to me as incredibly important for a community of practice to have value for its members. Considering our former class topics and readings, what is 1 connection/disconnection to CI 5323 overall?This course has been very deliberate in its self-reflective aspect, since we are reading about online communities while actively participating in them. Instructor deliberately asked those ""expansive questions"" to get us to think about how the suggestion from the text are/are not enacted in our online community, including both broadly thinking about the course, and reflecting on our own roles within the course. So the course is very ""meta"" in a way :-) What is 1 question or puzzle that you still have regarding the readings?I found chapter 8 to be a very practical discussion because collaboration is important for the workplace as well as in online learning communities. A question that popped into my head around page 170 is : What skills/roles/similarities exist between the online facilitator and a supervisor/manager in a professional setting? You could also ask what are the similarities between learners and employees in terms of collaboration. My workplace has had its share of challenges regarding collaboration, and I felt many of the suggestions in chapter 8 were relevant not only to our community here, but also to my workplace.","MKI"

"6","O you have made several nice points and I really agree with the importance of personal connection that the power that it has over learning.  I know for me as a learning if I am able to connect current material with past material, I have a much deeper understanding and ability to expand on the material.  The reflection process often provides the opportunity for connection as you think about what you have learned and how it relates to your current situation or past experiences.","MKC"
"7","O,__Thanks for highlighting the process check piece and its relation to adult learners. I think understanding students prior knowledge is always important but you make an important point with respect to valuing it with adult learners and not making assumptions about what is automatic with adult learners metacognition","MKC"
"8","Hi, O, I really agree with your point ""The check-in with students about their expectations about what they are learning is important for the instructor to stay up-to-date"". After I read those two chapters, I decide to add the ""expectation"" part in my online course :) This part can goes at the beginning of the class and also goes during the process. This would be helpful for instructors to modulate and for students to reflect and achieve in-depth thinking","MKC"

It has definately helped me be more comfortable in this course and I am sure others feel the same way. I can't remember who said this to me once but it goes something like this, Everyone has a story and they are just looking for someone to listen to it.""Out of curiosity, what was the name of the book you were reading that had a similar reference?I have never spent time out of education, but I am curious as how the content from Chapter 8 might be applied to in other professional situations.","SKC"

"11","Hi T, The book is ""Telling Ain't Training"" by Stolovich and Keeps, and I really recommend it! Even though it's technically about ""training"", it has a lot of interesting ideas for teaching in general and is written in a very friendly, easy-to-understand style. There is a really interesting section on metacognition and how you can recognize it and cultivate it in your students. I think there are a lot of connections between chapter 8 and professional environments, but one that pops into my head right now is the importance of good feedback. At least for myself, it's more motivational if I get really specific feedback on something to fix than really generic positive feedback. At least in my experience, it's really rare to get very specific feedback, positive or negative, from a supervisor. ","SKC"

"13","Hi, O:You certainly identified some key points from the reading that also resonated with me. For example that notion that the instructor needs to check in with students to determine what they are learning. When I thought about your post later on, however, I concluded that much of the ideas presented in the book are really common sense practices that instructors commonly adopt or should adopt. The structure of this course mirrors almost exactly many of the ideas presented in the book. Kukos to Instructor!One area that I struggle with in chapter 8 concerns collaboration. While in general I agree that collaboration is beneficial for all (students and instructor), I felt that the book did not address what happens when individual students have different learning objectives or career goals. And what about when students have different learning styles? ","MKC"

"15","Hi Everyone,I'm in a coffee shop, so I am opting to write (both for privacy and bandwidth), but isn't this the fun of taking an online class -- you can do it in a coffee shop!Some highlights for me:I'm a big fan of ""dialogue as inquiry"" as stated on pages 170-171.  It reminds me of the purpose of social studies education (which I am studying).  Schools are perhaps the most democratic places students will find themselves in.  That is, outside of school students are often with like-minded people, either through their own friends, parents' friends, relatives, religious organizations etc.  It is in school that we need to develop their ability to dialogue with people unlike themselves.  In an online environment, as the authors suggest, this kind of dialogue is set up right away and it builds.  If the instructor provides ""encouraging expansive questions"" and steps back the students will take over the dialogue.  The authors use Brookfield and Preskill's findings (2005) stating as such, ""the more successful students are at collaborating, the more they will seek it out"" (p. 171).  In my experiences of both teaching online and f-2-f, it seems in the online environment this collaboration, while sometimes more difficult actually produces better results.  The process matters!Another highlight for me is ""learning about technology by using it"", pages 195-196.  Simply put, I want my mom and dad to take an online class!  They keep asking me questions about technology that are out of context and it's extremely frustrating.  I strongly believe that if they took an online class they would not only gain confidence in their technological skills, but recognize the power of technology to learn in ways that meets the needs of the adult learner.Connections/Disconnections among readings:This book must have been difficult to write.  I say this because everything is so connected.  Topics loop and loop again.  Transformative learning takes place through the collaborative process, right?  At least that's how I see it.  Through collaboration and learning about your own strengths and weaknesses of collaborating with others you can't help but transform.  You cannot help but reflect on how it is going and your own role and how you would do it better.  So, to me it's all one big string that is looping back on itself.Connections/Disconnections to other topics in class:I'm still a little caught up in communities of practice.  I think that they can be wonderful and amazing if everyone is committed to them.  Otherwise, it could simply be a bunch of people who happen to do the same thing and they talk about it sometimes.  This is where the reflection piece discussed in Chapter 9 becomes important.  I think I'd like to see more reflection both individuals and the group would be important in a community of practice.  Otherwise, the potential for growth as a community become limited.  Through reflection you get to see your strengths and areas for growth.Puzzle:As I read the text, it mirrors my experiences as an online instructor and as an online student.  That is, they really push for the instructor to set up the class for student interaction and if the instructor does it well, they can step out of the way.  OK, yes.  I have learned several things I will do next time I teach online - yippee!  However, I'm still left wondering what online learning looks like for a content specific class, such as biology or history, where they are taught in a traditional lecture style format.  I want to see what that looks like done well, following what the text says we ought to do.  Has anyone seen that? Experienced it? What was it like?","MKI"

"19","Hi Everyone,I'm in a coffee shop, so I am opting to write (both for privacy and bandwidth), but isn't this the fun of taking an online class -- you can do it in a coffee shop!Some highlights for me:I'm a big fan of ""dialogue as inquiry"" as stated on pages 170-171.  It reminds me of the purpose of social studies education (which I am studying).  Schools are perhaps the most democratic places students will find themselves in.  That is, outside of school students are often with like-minded people, either through their own friends, parents' friends, relatives, religious organizations etc.  It is in school that we need to develop their ability to dialogue with people unlike themselves.  In an online environment, as the authors suggest, this kind of dialogue is set up right away and it builds.  If the instructor provides ""encouraging expansive questions"" and steps back the students will take over the dialogue.  The authors use Brookfield and Preskill's findings (2005) stating as such, ""the more successful students are at collaborating, the more they will seek it out"" (p. 171).  In my experiences of both teaching online and f-2-f, it seems in the online environment this collaboration, while sometimes more difficult actually produces better results.  The process matters!Another highlight for me is ""learning about technology by using it"", pages 195-196.  Simply put, I want my mom and dad to take an online class!  They keep asking me questions about technology that are out of context and it's extremely frustrating.  I strongly believe that if they took an online class they would not only gain confidence in their technological skills, but recognize the power of technology to learn in ways that meets the needs of the adult learner.Connections/Disconnections among readings:This book must have been difficult to write.  I say this because everything is so connected.  Topics loop and loop again.  Transformative learning takes place through the collaborative process, right?  At least that's how I see it.  Through collaboration and learning about your own strengths and weaknesses of collaborating with others you can't help but transform.  You cannot help but reflect on how it is going and your own role and how you would do it better.  So, to me it's all one big string that is looping back on itself.Connections/Disconnections to other topics in class:I'm still a little caught up in communities of practice.  I think that they can be wonderful and amazing if everyone is committed to them.  Otherwise, it could simply be a bunch of people who happen to do the same thing and they talk about it sometimes.  This is where the reflection piece discussed in Chapter 9 becomes important.  I think I'd like to see more reflection both individuals and the group would be important in a community of practice.  Otherwise, the potential for growth as a community become limited.  Through reflection you get to see your strengths and areas for growth.Puzzle:As I read the text, it mirrors my experiences as an online instructor and as an online student.  That is, they really push for the instructor to set up the class for student interaction and if the instructor does it well, they can step out of the way.  OK, yes.  I have learned several things I will do next time I teach online - yippee!  However, I'm still left wondering what online learning looks like for a content specific class, such as biology or history, where they are taught in a traditional lecture style format.

"20","M- your second quote ""learning about technology by using it"" was something that caught my eye as well.  I started online learning three years ago and I can't believe how far I have come.  Technology like many other things is something that is ever changing and you must use it to stay up on the skills.  I also think that technology is ""scary"" for many users and you must be able to get over this to be able to take the leap and learn.  Online classes are an exciting way to learn and to connect with others.  I am hoping that someday I will be able to launch an online parenting class.  We will see but this class has really been helpful in learning so much about communities","MKC"

"23","Hi M, some things about your response jumped out at me. I thought for a while about if school is the most democratic place students actually find themselves in. Maybe democratic isn't so much the descriptive word I would use as diverse. I guess at least from my experience, not all schools are either that democratic or that diverse (although some are), but I agree that it's important for schools to develop student's ability to dialogue with people different from themselves, particularly because this is a good trait to learn earlier in life.Your response also made me think about how asking ""expansive questions"" can really get at how people think differently and have different perspectives from each other. I agree with you and the book that expansive, open ended questions are a great way to open a dialogue and lead into lessons about how to talk/collaborate with people who have different identities than yourself.","SKC"

"35","Wow, I come back from vacation and what an interesting discussion there is :-) _One technique that was suggested in a book I read about introverts in terms of making discussion spaces more friendly for them is to send out the discussion questions ahead of time. If you have a class that meets f2f once a week, perhaps send out the discussion questions each week so that those who might need time to incubate have that sort of time. As an introvert myself, I have found this really helpful (slash frustrating when its doesn't happen) in a work environment. If a meeting agenda is sent out ahead of time and the Leaders clearly and specifically communicate what we'll discuss, then I can come to the meeting really prepared to give thoughtful input. If I walk into a meeting without a clear idea of what it's about, then it is a lot harder for me to offer substantial comments.","DKC"
"36","Hi M,Your last paragraph is something that resonated with me...echoes what I have been thinking about for a while, but in reverse! How can discussions around sensitive topics transfer to an online space? Here's the background...As part of my previous program, I also completed a minor in another CEHD department.

There was a great deal of discussion a while back about moving their certificate program online, but ultimately the faculty decided that the online space was not conducive to the types of discussions that they wanted to cultivate in the classroom. Discussions around power, privilege, social justice, classim, racism, many heavy topics that call for a skilled teacher/facilitator who has experience working with groups consisting of individuals at different points in their awareness of these topics. As an educator, how can the potentially transformative process of education work online, and what do I need to do in order to make that happen?

It was a fascinating read, and it reminded me of an article I read a while back (actually, for a course in the minor program I described above) that talked about similar ideas as yours - namely, how to encourage and work through healthy conflict in a classroom when sensitive topics are the topic of discussion.

Indeed, some transformative learning theorists sometimes use terms associated with religious experience such as ""spiritual"", ""renewal"". ","MKC"
"49","Hi, N:Of the two arguments you mention against the term ""transformative,"" I might just agree with Newman's opinion that it's just good learning. I don't feel the same way about ""transformative"" connoting something that cannot be applied to learning or education, since I guess I believe that learning is a fundamental and profound process that is well in line with my idea of ""transformative.""","MKC"
"50","N,Some of the educators' works I read also get at your point - of transformation moreso in the spiritual realm. I can see your argument for its use in that context. I would ask the follow-up question of what is it that's being described as transformative? Is it someone's thought process? Their worldview? What may be transformative to one person may not be for another, depending on where each person is coming from. ","MKC"
"51","M:Your discussion with G really intrigues me. When a class is grappling with sensitive topics, it seems to me that the facilitator's real-time input can be critical to keeping the discussion within the bounds of civil discourse. Hurtful things can be said f2f, of course, but there's also the opportunity to diffuse the situation immediately. Asynchronous discourse allows us to ruminate, and potentially, fume or sulk. So, my question is, how does the needed guidance and facilitation happen in an online environment? Moderated posts, perhaps, or confining inflammable topics to synchronous meetings?I'd also be interested in looking at how old the learners should be before something like this is attempted.","SKC"

"81","Definitely agree, ""Learning about technology by using it!"" Twitter is such a great example to use. Like yourself, I joined Twitter in 2009 and didn't really use it much until about 2012.

"82","G, I definitely agree with you that connecting content to real world happenings is so important. I know often times I tend to ignore things in classes because I can't make a connection to why this would be important for me to use in the real world. Making these connections is so important for students because it helps them see the importance of what they are learning about! Great point!","MKC"
"83","G, I appreciated your insight about the benefits of online students introducing themselves and, with guidance from the instructor, reply back to each other in an effort to mitigate the feelings of solitude among members - and that in typical F2F courses, only the self-introductions are done, rarely with any feedback from the others. I hadn't thought about this aspect of the F2F courses, but it's generally true, in my experience. Not until we break into groups and begin working together in the F2F environment, do we really come to know each other. Interesting comparison.","MKC"
"84","Identify 2 highlights from the readings. These could be quotes, ideas, or things you learned that resonated with you. One idea that I strongly agree with is _Encouraging Comment on Introductions? It says, _All of us need acknowledgement and to feel welcomed into a new situation. The promotion of human connection allows students to begin forming the relationships that are the basis for collaborative learning.?(Chapter 8, pp.164).Introduction is a traditional and excellent icebreaker, and also it facilitates the building of social presence. Comment from peers is something of significance to make one feel being accepted and welcomed, and not a dispensable visitor, which will affect ones positivity and initiative to join further class activities to a great extent. Moreover, initiating communication and interaction from comment helps to build relationships among classmates in a short time, and indirectly devotes to the development of sense of a community.Another quote struck me out is that _critical self-reflection is a crucial component of transformative learning and that, in fact, transformative learning cannot occur without it?(Chapter 9, pp.198). As transformative learning is the process of perspective transformation, and it is about who I am as a person, have I changed and how I changed. So, self-reflection, which does answer those questions, plays a critical role in transformative learning. What is 1 connection/disconnection among the readings? From my point of view, Chapter 8 and Chapter 9 are closely tied together. Chapter 8, _Promoting Collaborative Learning? talks about the means of formulation of a share goal for learning, real-life applications as springboards for learning, and dialogue as inquiry, which seems like the preparation, and means towards _Transformative Learning?that Chapter 9 is about. What is 1 question/puzzle that you still have regarding the readings? While I was reading examples of posts by Mike in pp.201, a question bumped into my mind. Students attempt to express who they are textually in an online course, however, it seems informal to write assignments that way.

"90","It seems that questioning and higher order thinking skills are mentioned on page 171 under encouraging expansive questioning. It is stated that ""when students become excited by the learning that expansive questions create, they can become adept at asking the same types of questions themselves.

It works with some groups and some students struggle with it. As a facilitator you cannot provide too many leads in the direction of critical thinking as the group must critically expand their own thoughts. Content background knowledge is the starting point but where it can go from there depends upon the group with some groups needing more facilitation than others. The key lies in the balance of providing too many leads or too little support. The ways to add more collaboration is through ""blogs, wikis, web pages, jigsaw activities, online journals, webQuests"" etc that encourage learning through activities that encourage and support collaboration.The connection between the readings is clear in the process and the implementation phases of teaching and learning.

"94","Q,__ I also resonated with the text discussion of expansive questioning. I have been reading about the idea of knowledge transfer in teaching undergraduates science and Randi Engle's idea of expansive framing to promote this type of learning transfer.  I liked the idea that part of this expansive framing can be placed in the hands of the students by encouraging the collaborative student to student interaction and questioning. I wondered whether a collaborative approach would help that learning persist beyond the single course experience?","SKC"

In page 158, Jonassen and others note that the collaborative in a constructivist classroom results not only in personal meaning-making on the part of the individual student, but also creates a container wherein social construction of knowledge and meaning can occur. This means that learning is not only an independent behavior by learners themselves, but also an interdependent process among learners. It's also important to form a constructivist community which helps learners to achieve active and reflective learning. 2. In page 162-163, two ways would help achieve collaborative learning are proposed. One is sharing the expectations of the course and another one is use of team charters. I will use these methods in my online course in the next semester.What is 1 connection/disconnection among the readings? One connection I have found is about the learner-centered focus. In a successful online learning community, we may have a close look at roles of students and instructors. Instructor is an equal player, acting only as a gentle guide while learners' roles might be a facilitator, team Leader, presenter or commentator. And instructors must be willing to give up control of the direction and act as a participating member, allowing students to take the discussion wherever it might go. Considering our former class topics and readings, what is 1 connection/disconnection to CI 5323 overall or prior readings? I think this course has formulated a good shared goal, negotiating guidelines and kind communication environment which are very important for our social presences online. It also has formed a context that we could bring our life experiences into this online course.

"103","Hi R,The difference between a self-evaluation and a team-evaluation is that you are only evaluating yourself in the former. The self-evaluation gives you a chance to reflect on your effort and provides the instructor with an idea of how you feel you performed. On the other hand, a team-evaluation gives all members of the team an opportunity to assess your performance. Often times, team members' ratings are averaged. When this feedback is shared with the instructor, it allows the instructor to gain better insight on how the team worked together. If all of the team members have good things to say about each other, we assume they worked well together. If all the team members identify a single person as a ""slacker,"" this is also noteworthy. One thing that should always be considered, however, is that sometimes team members don't say anything negative because they fear that this may affect their grade or that others may not share the same feelings and they don't want to put an unnecessary light on themselves. I hope this helps answer your question!","MKC"
"104","Thank you, A. It's really helpful! And it's also an issue that team members don't say anything negative because they fear that this may affect their grade and sometimes this would happen to self-evaluation, right?","MKC"
"105","These are good comments pertaining to team evaluations. _I had to evaluate team papers or lesson plans. _This is a bit different than having to evaluate a team member in a group project. _So as I become an instructor I will keep in mind that I want positive and strength base approach, so I would keep it as an approach to strengthen each others work. _For example, if we as a team evaluated another teams community site, we could critique it in the strength base approach, looking for the positive and ways to support the team to be more effective as an instructor (if needed) Does that make sense???","DKC"
"106","Highlights. One of the simple ideas that I really like is that shared goals are a critical component of developing an effective community. One of the reasons I find academic communities to be much more effective than non-academic communities is that instructors and students naturally work toward clear goals that are tied to learning and completing the course. When utilizing a non-academic community, members may not necessarily be working toward common goals. They may be searching for advice or support but what they do with that information and, ultimately, their end-goal may not be the same. Connections. Chapter 9 discusses learning about technology by using it. This jumped out at me right away because that is exactly the feeling I've had during this course, thus far. I have learned about a number of new technologies and it wasn't until I actually used the technology (e.g., VoiceThread, Flipgrid) that I saw it's true value and could appreciate the medium. I believe this also means that there is some pressure on instructors to utilize the best types of technology, as well as a wide variety of technologies to allow students to gain exposure and promote learning.I thought the example of the female student who disappeared for awhile after her introduction was interesting, too. I believe we have come across this example before. I think this is definitely noteworthy because it demonstrates expectations and the impact not meeting those expectations has on people. This example reminds me a little bit of Facebook and how people often post status updates or photos and truly measure how many friends they have by the number of ""likes"" or responses. I think this is potentially destructive but, no doubt, plays a huge role in online communities. I suppose the takeaway is that we need to manage our expectations, as well as communicate clearly, and we shouldn't measure our worth by the feedback. Additionally, this relates to the point I made in the beginning of the semester where we should try to view others in a positive light, as opposed to negatively. We shouldn't assume non-responses mean that people don't care but rather they didn't know they were supposed to respond or got really busy. Question. Chapter 8 discusses being a team player in terms of collaboration. A number of my classes that place on emphasis on group work require a group assessment at the end where group members rate the effort of their team members and the teacher uses it when calculating a final grade.

"110","A- I really was able to connect with your thoughts about the student who disappeared- I have not done this- but I often feel concerned when others do not post or reply to my work.  I worry that I say something wrong and was off base about the material.  Even though I am not in class face to face with the students and teacher I still get concerned about what others might be thinking about my work.  I do often have to remember just as you stated, ""we shouldn't measure our worth by the feedback"".  Thanks for the good message.","MKC"
"111","As the discussion above....I don't think it is appropriate. _I feel the instructor can roam the different groups and pretty much see for her self if someone is not participating enough. _For another classmate to rate another, I don't feel is appropriate, it does not stay in the strength base approach. _Supporting each other on the work and helping to improve is different than rating efforts. _Teams are hard to work in, but you do find a way to support each other.....As an instructor I personally would stay clear of rating classmates..","MKC"
"112","H,I have been in classes with group work, and at the end of the class or group project there was a group evaluation piece. Each instructor handled it differently - one of them asked that we evaluate our team members' work in a typical fashion (more like a rating system). The other instructor asked us to evaluate our group experience - while you could argue that the end result may have been the same (as far as the answers that the instructors received), the process by which it was handled made a difference in that it did not feel like one team member was pitted against the other.","DKC"
"113","Peer evaluation or review is an excellent practice in the academic world. I think that students should do an anonymous job on it and not know who the reviewers are or whose paper they are reviewing. That would provide feedback and not be too personal. Also, there can be guidelines such as make a two positive and two can do better upon comments. ","DKC"
"114","A, your first comment about the differences between academic communities vs. non-academic communities, relative to shared goals, is one that resonates with me - my non-academic online community postings can tend to wander off into some pretty deep recesses at times, while members in pursuit of the same goal choosing to break off of the divergent conversation thread in order to re-establish their topic of focus (their shared goal). I do appreciate this aspect of the academic online experience, which is both directed and self-directed.","MKC"

"127","T - I echo your comment about the age of the learners. That is a question that I have had for a couple years now - particularly watching my daughter go through school, and seeing how her school approaches learning. (and also on the parenting/teaching side on a personal level with her) I don't have the background in either a practical or theoretical sense to be able to really even better formulate any questions around it...which is why I have greatly valued the K-12 educators' presence in classes! I'm hoping we can start figuring this out together. I think it was in our Intro to LT class (either the first or second session) that we split into groups to answer the question of what is good learning. (Anyone remember what I'm talking about? I think others have taken that class before, and I suspect the format may have been similar across the offerings.)Also, I think it would be incredibly difficult to take a research methods class online, and not have anyone except the instructor with whom to talk about it.","SKC"

"129","G,Thanks for the reply and insight. I do worry about how we are preparing our high school students to face the ever changing learning environments that they will meet in post secondary options. I don't want to diminish my field of study (fine arts & ceramics) but I am not in a position to contribute as much as I would like.  I agree that there needs to be a discussion linking secondary and post-secondary institutions if we are to encourage change. Hopefully that will be something I can be a part of. I don't know if disappointed is the right word, but it is discouraging to see so much of this research identify only adult learners and grad students.There has to be a way to make this effective and approachable to our 9-12 students at least.","DKC"
"130","Highlights:One quote that really resonated with me is found on pg.171; ""Brookfeld and Preskill (2005) state that collaboration can become addictive: the more successful students are at collaborating, the more they will seek it out. Therefore, promoting good, collaborative discussion can assist them in developing an appreciation for other forms of collaborative work."" After reading this, I had a ""hmmm"" moment as it really made me think about my experiences in collaborating with other students, both in class, and other online and f2f classes I've taken in the past. Does collaboration really become addictive for me? I don't necessarily agree, but I do agree that good collaborative discussions assist in developing an appreciation for other forms of collaborative work. I also appreciated the quote on pg. 179 from Stephen Covey (1989), discussing the ability to ""seek first to understand, then be understood."" This further defines the importance of interdependence and the need for each online learner to gravitate towards interdependence to have more meaningful collaborative discussions. What is 1 connection/disconnection among the readings? The strongest connection among the two chapters for me was its ability to tie collaboration to transformational learning. I see a strong connection between integrating collaboration into an online learning environment and then being able to create a transformational experience for the student. Even though transformational experiences are usually unconsciously driven, it's imperative to integrate collaborative learning exercises and activities into an online course, so those transformational experiences come to light. I felt these two chapters connected with each other really well and helped me to understand how to build collaboration and transformation together within a course. Considering our former class topics and readings, what is 1 connection/disconnection to CI 5323 overall or prior readings? All of our previous readings and class topics integrate so well into the overarching theme of ""Online Learning Communities."" What is 1 question or puzzle that you still have regarding the readings? I'd like to further investigate how f2f environments differ with online environments as they relate to transformational learning.

Although I've read studies showing that this type of peer review performs as well as instructor evaluations, I have a hard time believing this. The book's discussion of this issue on P. 166 includes the possibility of this practice setting up a sense of competition between members, rather than cooperation, within the group. However, I do believe team self-evaluation can encourage members to join a higher-functioning team, as mentioned on P. 167, as everyone wants to be part of a winning team ;)","DKI"
