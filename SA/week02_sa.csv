1,"After searching for scholarly articles that explore community, the results produced numerous papers and books that examine community around one's identity and personal needs.Merriam-Webster defines community as ""a unified body of individuals.""I would define community as a group of people that share a mutual identity, whether it be race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation. Furthermore, I believe a community is comprised of people who strongly associate themselves with that group.For me, an ""online community"" is one where the definitions above are present but, perhaps even more important, people are able to develop a true social presence. In other words, members of the group must be able to develop and convey a true sense of themselves that includes their personality, passions, interests, and emotions. In order to do this, members must engage clearly and frequently, as well as communicate effectively. I really like the book's definition of online communities as a virtual space where people ""come together in meaningful ways"" and with a sense of ""purpose."" Additionally, it is important for whichever platform is being utilized to have a clear structure. This is my vision of a successful online community. It's when people bring all parts of themselves to an online space, using a variety of technology, and are able to use the structure of the virtual space to help other members gain a perspective (and hopefully an accurate one) of who they are. Community members learn about one another, develop common interests, and eventually trust each other enough to rely on members and look to each other to learn more about others and themselves. With our culture being heavily dependent on body language to help us decipher messages and a need for face-to-face interactions, I believe developing a strong, viable online community poses great difficulty. I come from a background where online communities feel a little unnatural, so I am very excited to stretch myself outside of my comfort zone and I look forward to developing peer relationships in a virtual space.

6,"I love the community word cloud.  I think all those words together really bring the idea of community to life.  I agree with several pieces from your post.  In order for a Community to be effective there must be a strong level of trust.  Without trust the group can never really develop into a deeper learning environment.  I also agree with you thoughts on body language.  I am a learner who really used people non-verbal to help me learn and understand, the lack of this in a on-line community can post a challenge. Thank you for sharing your ideas and including the great cloud",MKC

13,"After reading the first chapter of ""Building online learning communities"" and searching for some articles and Wikipedia information, I have had an initial conception of ""online learning community"". In my opinion, two kinds of actors- facilitator and learner are fundamental factors in online learning community.

More importantly, only this constructivist context can be considered as ""online learning community"". Communities which are used as a platform to deliver teaching materials by instructors are not ""online learning community"".In order to form a social constructivist context, facilitator should clarify course goals, objectives, expected outcomes, guidelines, collaborative assignments to learners. During the learning process, the learner who is open-minded sharing, self-motivated and self-disciplined are more likely to be a successful online learner. Online activities (performed by both learners and facilitator) include social presence, collaborative activities, interactions and communications, reflective and transformative learning, etc. Details of these concepts please watch my Prezi shown below.My Prezi: What's online learning community?I believe community is important in online learning spaces. Because I believe learning is a social process.

I feel that I have been able to be successful because I am self motivated and have a lot of back ground knowledge about the subject.

18,"R,I was able to get the Prezi up. What I particularly appreciated about it was the notion of the online community as active members constructing knowledge through discourse. I also liked that you included reflection. I think reflection might be one of the trickiest things to include in an online community. Because the nature of the community may be asynchronous, members maybe feel like they have come late to the party and not be able to slow down to reflect. Thanks for taking the time to put together this visual",MKC

44,"I, I definitely agree that an online learning community should be a place where people can express freely and keep an open mind to other people's opinions. I think sometimes this can be a little harder in an online class because when people are having a discussion you are only ever reading their responses. You are not able to read someone's body language and other things that people take advantage of when they are face to face. But if everyone is open minded I think people's differences in opinions can be amazing in an online learning community because it gets everyone thinking.",MKC
45,"J, _I agree with you, it is definitely harder to express yourself through an online class since you don't get to hear how each person verbally contributes.

I'm not entirely sure how someone would move from lurker to contributer...maybe someone else in the community personally reached out to that person and contacted/talked to him/her - that interaction might prompt that person to then interact in more ways in the community, or with additional community members. Just some thoughts off the top of my head. Does anyone else have ideas with this? I'm curious too..",MKC
70,"I wish I could see your mind map, G! It sounds interesting. One thing that may move a person from lurker to participant is becoming more knowledgeable, either about the community and its norms (because it's someone who has arrived recently and wants to find out what it's like there) or about the subject matter. If I'm coming in cold, I like to suss out a group a bit before I participate.

We want to create a community for our students where they can feel safe and comfortable but also where they are able to expand their knowledge as students and as individuals. When I think about an online learning community I think these same values are important. People need to be able to feel safe and comfortable to express their opinions without feeling as though they are going to be attacked if their opinions aren't the same as everyone else's. That being said if everyone is open minded to other's opinions online learning communities are great because you get to work with people and learn about their opinions and views. I like this because most of the time I work with elementary education students and we often have the same views on things, so it is nice to be able to work with people who may have views different than my own.

90,"Yes. I think one of the reasons it can do that is because we communicate in writing, which allows us--especially those of us who are introverted--to consider first, and then respond. We can re-read what has been said and think about the conversation as a whole. We can address a comment to a particular person and take time to acknowledge others' responses to our comments... And it seems to me that we've covered more ground in this thread than we might have in a typical class discussion. So, yes.",MKC

(Palloff and Pratt, 2007, p. 4) I think about the semesters I loathed my online classes and I know they were the semesters that I was frustrated by my students?participation or lack thereof. _I was frustrated that they were not contributing at the level I wanted them to. _So_I became a bit of a tyrant, demanding that they do things in a very specific way. _In a face-to-face class teachers can do that more, we can control the conversations that take place, redirect it in a way we want it to go in a very short amount of time. _It only takes the teachers questioning or direct comment and everyone hears it all at once and know to move the conversation that way. _This is not true of online threaded discussions because not everyone is there at that precise moment. _But, thats also the point. _Like the quote says, there is collaboration in the learning, not a teacher dictating how the learning is to take place. _That's what makes it a unique community!Another item from the text that struck me was that successful students in distance education programs are _able to communicate through writing?(Palloff and Pratt, 2007, p. 8). I couldnt help but think that talkers _win?in f-2-f classes, but writers _win?in online classes. _But, dont good writers always win? _That is, ultimately in higher education if you are a strong writer no matter f-2-f or online you will come out on top because after all the major assignments always involve writing. _How can we change that dynamic, even just a little, so that more people can win?Finally, I am intrigued by the difference between presence and interaction as described on page 12. _I think about some stories I have read about how people have become actually lonelier or depressed through social media such as Facebook (FB). _In most of these stories the key was that on FB and other social media people are marketing themselves. _That is, they are posting images of themselves on vacation or some other fantastic place because they want to show the world how great their life is. _Its almost like marketing a product. _If this is true, then wouldnt that be considered presence, but not true interaction? _As in, the comments below the wonderful picture, _looks like fun,?_you look amazing!? etc.? _It seems to me friends are acknowledging presence not truly interacting. _OK, dont get me wrong, I am just as guilty of this stuff as anyone_Im just contemplating this idea. In looking for an article that discusses community I found an interesting one: _Developing Online Learning Communities?by Mark. A. Maddix in Christian Education Journal (Series 3, Vol. 10, No.1). _I am neither Christian nor religious, but I found this article intriguing because it deals with the idea of larger community values within an individual classroom community. _In Christian universities one of the elements of their teaching is helping young people in the forming and shaping of their faith. _Classes, therefore, are not just about the content (e.g., history, chemistry), but about modeling Christian values and beliefs. _The concern is that in online classes these values and beliefs may not be modeled. _Moreover, some theologians argue that embodiment is key to molding these beliefs and values and physical presence is necessary. _Maddix presents an alternative viewpoint through various research. _Of particular interest to me is John Greshams research that argues for a _divine pedagogy?or __the pedagogy of the incarnation [that] points to the realm of the student's life experience as the locus of divine saving action?(Maddix, p. 142 and Gresham, 2006, p. 26). _In other words, to use Greshams language again, _divine pedagogy includes a communal dimension similar to the church, [it] provides active participation of students in the learning process, and is relevant to online education because it is rich in symbols and signs that communicate meaning?(Maddix, p. 142 and Gresham 2006, p. 27-28). _I read such statements as a redefining of community or rather we must not assume that we are a community simply because we share similar values and beliefs. _Rather we must continuously build community and allow the actors to be active, challenged, and provide space for difference and growth. _In other words, we cant just say our community has these values and beliefs and that you will pick them up simply by your presence. _I like this.In sum, then, an online community really needs to be genuine in its efforts to be a community. _We can't just be together in this space, we need to engage in it.",DKI
101,"Hi M, what an amazing comment! I am very interested in this paragraph : ""I am intrigued by the difference between presence and interaction as described on page 12. _I think about some stories I have read about how people have become actually lonelier or depressed through social media such as Facebook (FB). _In most of these stories the key was that on FB and other social media people are marketing themselves. _That is, they are posting images of themselves on vacation or some other fantastic place because they want to show the world how great their life is. _Its almost like marketing a product. _If this is true, then wouldnt that be considered presence, but not true interaction? _As in, the comments below the wonderful picture, _looks like fun,?_you look amazing!? etc.? _It seems to me friends are acknowledging presence not truly interacting. _OK, dont get me wrong, I am just as guilty of this stuff as anyone_Im just contemplating this idea. "" it seems like a psychological issue about people's behavior patterns in social networking sites. I totally agree with the viewpoint that this kind of presence in FB is not true interaction. But I do believe Facebook has its potential to engage people in true interactions. If we take advantage of FB in our online courses, we should think carefully about the curriculum design.",MKC
102,"Hi M and R,The difference between presence and interaction caught my eye too. As far as FB goes, I wonder if the real interaction (such as it is) on FB happens less on public posts and walls, but more in the private messaging. So there are almost two sides to how we present our virtual identity on FB - the attention-getting public side of pictures and status updates, and the more personal, true interaction on the private side. It also makes me wonder to what extent a online community is strengthened when its members know each other offline - perhaps we can understand better the ""meaning between the words"" when we read text from someone we know personally, but on the other hand, we have to work harder to make ourselves understood and to understand others when we only have their words to go off of.",DKC
103,"Hi, O,I read some articles about how to form online community in FB. It mentioned learners used FB group in online collaboration rather than merely used individual accounts to make communications. But I have never used FB group before, maybe we could try it in this course :)",DKC
104,"Your comments that we can't assume our way into community based on a presupposition of shared values and beliefs reminds me that all relationship, to be meaningful and productive, require work. I think it's good to remember that we have to put forth an effort to experience the benefits of community, in this class and in all of our communities",MKC
105,"Again, so sorry to be late to the conversation!Sometimes it's helpful to define by negation: What groups of people would not count as community? What online groups would not count as an online community? (And then what word would we use to describe them?)For some reason I thought of the reviews on Amazon.com (and similar sites). I use reviews whenever making a purchase - but I wonder if that would qualify as a community. Definitely it is a group of people constructing knowledge together, and there is some level of trust that the people posting reviews have in fact used the product. However, there isn't any extended relationship with each other. I don't think most of us would count that as an ""online community"" in the way we've been talking about them, but I can't think of a word that I would use to describe that group of people besides ""community"". Words can be tricky...I think the internet is bringing people together into collections that maybe we don't have specific words for yet. ",MKI

That's true - the online space is changing at such a fast pace continuously that it's hard to make sense of it at times. That's what I both struggle with and enjoy about online interactions. It's been a fun experience to pop in and out of various groups online, I'm thinking mostly of Twitter here.",MKC
108,"Oh, G and O,That reminds me of when I learned that other cultures (other than European-American, which is the one I grew up in), have words for relatives that I don't have words for--like my brother's wife's mother. What is she to me? Mother-in-law...but not quite. These online interactions may turn out to be distinct things that need names. I love that idea!",MKC
109,"First of all, i am so sorry for late posting and it won't happen again i promise.After I read the chapter one and some researches from UMN library about online learning community, the first word came up my head was ""small challenge."" The term community is generally defined as usually small, social unit of any size that shares common values. So based on this definition online learning community is the small social unit of any size that shares learning about some topic through online. The reason i called it as small challenge is that the online class has some differences form the off line class and due to those differences it could be more challenging than normal class. I have taken three online classes and the online class needs more participation and responsibility than normal class i think. According to text book, learning in the distance education environment cannot be passive. Students are not only responsible for logging on but they must also contribute to the learning process by posting their thoughts and ideas to the online discussion. Learning is an active process in which both the instructor and the learners must participate it if it is to be successful.",MKI

111,"P, I like how you used the word ""small challenge"" to describe what online learning communities are. I believe that taking online classes allow one to feel more comfortable to add what they like to any conversation after thinking through what they want to say. I personally feel that asking and answering questions in a large lecture room is more intimidating because once the question is asked, you have to jog your memory as fast as you can to come up with an answer. It is a challenge though to keep up with the course work for online learning communities and to really read so you know what you are writing about.",MKC
112,"I see community as a group of people sharing the same area of interest or experience - and in thinking about the Community of Practice, I was drawn to Richard Millington's statement that, ""Every online community lives within an ecosystem. Even a community that defines its ecosystem is still encompassed within it."" He goes on to say that, ""To make matters more confusing, a community can exist in more than one ecosystem."" So, I think of my profession of dental hygiene, living within the ecosystem of organized dentistry. Every-so-often, state Boards of Dentistry make major changes to the individual services that a dental hygienist can legally provide to their patients. So, this larger ecosystem change can greatly impact my dental hygiene community. Additionally, these dental hygiene members can be affected by other ecosystems, like the dental insurance ecosystem, which could decide that having one's teeth cleaned, x-rayed and examined should no longer be a covered benefit, which would have profound effects on both my dental hygiene community and its larger ecosystem of organized dentistry, at a minimum. So, this has caused me to think about community not as an insular, members-only club, but rather as a dynamic group which is constantly acting and reacting to what's taking place both within and without the community - the ""issues, media, people, competition and trends"" (Millington) affecting this group of people are what really constitute an online community.",MKI

114,"As I read through everyone's definitions of online communities, I noticed a lot of recurring concepts and words. Many people mentioned participation, engagement, interaction, feeling comfortable or safe with the other community members, sharing a common purpose or goal, and creating knowledge through collaboration. Those who answered the question of whether community is important in online spaces said, ""Yes."" The reasons circled back to the benefits that showed up in the definitions--it encourages engagement, which is linked to student performance and satisfaction, it facilitates collaboration.I also found the many differences and differing perspectives interesting. I appreciated reading what everyone had to say.",DKC
115,"I read this article for another class in this week -- From Moodle to Facebook: Exploring students' motivation and experie.... I wanna use some citations in this article to summarize this topic-- ""what's a good online learning community"". 1. a strong online learning community should have its social and emotional as well as intellectual and academic dimensions; 2.the presence of a community is necessary for online participation and learning, and for a need to maintain the balance between interaction for social purposes and that for learning;3. the social presence of learners and instructors helps form the sense of community, and it's also necessary to make roles of members, and rules of community.Anyway, this is an interesting article. You guys could check it out if you are also interested in online social learning :)",SKI
116,"I wanted to add, that what I've learned from my brief exposure to online learning - and I am lucky enough to have learned best practices in online instruction from the experts here at the U - is the critical role that community plays in these environments. And I have found myself compelled to share this critical element with faculty here in my own discipline, who are planning to develop online courses without the benefit of this coursework in CI.For example, a colleague of mine, who heads a program here, is hiring an instructional designer to help her _develop a hybrid graduate degree program - and she mentioned using Moodle. I was compelled to send her the grid I developed last semester, comparing the social affordances of the two systems, and letting her know of the importance of this sense of community/social aspect of online learning, vs. using a far more limited content management system like Moodle. I hope she will consider this, for the long-term success of her graduate program, where one of the goals in this digital age *should* be to form important relationships that people will carry with them into their professional life. Community is key in online learning.",DKI
117,"Instructor and S, considering the important social interaction seems to be and how limited you both have found Moodle to be (I'm pretty new to Moodle, and haven't had the time to evaluate it), what do you suppose we in LT can do to encourage the University to consider either moving away from Moodle, or--if that is unlikely, and at this moment it appears to be--adding affordances to Moodle somehow? Is that work underway? (Am I being completely naive?)",MKC
118,"S, Instructor, F, I so appreciate the information in these comments! I wasn't sure if I was the only one who couldn't stand Moodle, but I could never put my finger on exactly why :-) It totally is the emphasis of content over engagement...and as someone who hopes do instructional design for the U someday, hopefully that will change at some point!",MKC
119,"Thanks for the acknowledgement, Instructor. I've used Moodle, and as you mentioned to Tracey, it would be very difficult to change OIT and ATS to support a different CMS. Moodle does take some time getting used to, but OIT does see it as an effective tool for students and faculty at the U of M, and currently that's what they support. I do know of other faculty that are using other CMS's like Coursera to create their own online learning course, so it will be interesting to see how things evolve in the future. For those that can't stand Moodle, I would suggest taking some time and really learning the ins and outs of its use...",DKC
120,"Wow, great comments, everyone! Makes me wonder even more what enhancements/modules/add-ons might be able to be implemented to Moodle to increase its affordances for engagement an interaction. I shall dig into it and see what I can find out.
